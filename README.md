# SuperHeroVR

## This is a SuperHero selection VR app for Google Cardboard (thus any Android phone running 4.4 and up).

This has been built with Unity for Google Cardboard. It also uses the GoogleVR SDK.

The environment is a cube room which gives a nice and cozy feel to the app. The cube has six super heroes.
You can **interact** with it by tapping the cardboard button when you look at the cube. On doing so the cube will spin in different directions and reveal your super hero.
